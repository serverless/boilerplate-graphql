# Serverless GraphQL

This starter kit is an opinionated set of tools combined to help you get started building a Serverless application with an GraphQL endpoint and deploy them to production in minutes.

This example uses the following technologies:

- Frontend
	- Apollo Client
	- React

- Backend
	- Serverless
	- AWS Lambda & AWS API Gateway
	- Apollo Lambda Server
	- Serverless Webpack
	- Serverless Offline

## System Architecture

## Setup

You need to have Node 6 or higher installed.

```
npm install -g serverless
npm install -g yarn
```

Configure your AWS keys. Here you can find a [2min walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRkUnA3mEt4) how to do retrieve the keys.

```
sls config credentials --provider aws --key <your_aws_access_key> --secret <your_aws_secret_key>
```

Install Dependencies (FrontEnd and BackEnd)
```
cd app-backend
yarn install
cd ../app-client
yarn install
```

Test Locally - Use Apollo Lambda Server
```
# Start Server http://localhost:4000/graphql
cd app-backend
yarn run start-server-lambda:offline
```

## Start Client

```
# Start Client http://localhost:3000
cd app-client
yarn start
```

OR

```
# Start Client http://localhost:3000
cd app-backend
yarn run start-client-local
```

## Setup for Production

1. [Setup Cognito](https://medium.com/@kangzeroo/user-management-with-aws-cognito-1-3-initial-setup-a1a692a657b3)

2. Insert credentials in app-client/generate-token.js
3. Replace <cognito_pool_id> and <aws_account_id> with appropriate values in serverless.yml

4. Use live data from the development environment. You need to make sure you have access to your deployed lambda functions. This works only after you deployed it to production.
```
cd app-backend
yarn run deploy-server-lambda-prod
```

```

## Multiple package.json

In order to keep the total amount of code uploaded to AWS Lambda small the `foundation/app-server` directory containing the Serverless service has it's own `package.json`. This speeds up uploading and also should reduce the cold start time of Lambda functions. You don't have to run `yarn install` manually at any point. It will only happen during deploy, but you need make sure every library you are consuming in your GraphQL endpoint is added as a dependency there.

### `app-client/package.json`

- dependencies: dependencies used by the front-end
- devDependencies: dependencies used to package the front-end application & running the local environment

### `app-backend/package.json`

- dependencies: dependencies used on AWS Lambda
