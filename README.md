# Serverless GraphQL

This starter kit is an opinionated set of tools combined to help you get started building a Serverless application with an GraphQL endpoint and deploy them to production in minutes.

This example uses the following technologies:

- Frontend
	- Apollo Client
	- React

- Backend
	- Serverless
	- Apollo Lambda Server
	- Serverless Webpack
	- Serverless Offline

## System Architecture

## Start Server

You need to have Node 6 or higher installed.

```
npm install -g serverless
npm install -g yarn
```

Install Dependencies (FrontEnd and BackEnd)
```
cd foundation/app-server
yarn install
cd app-client
yarn install
```

Test Locally - Use Apollo Lambda Server
```
# Start Server http://localhost:4000/graphql
cd foundation/app-server
npm run start-server-lambda:offline
```

## Start Client

```
# Start Client http://localhost:3000
cd app-client
npm start
```

OR

```
# Start Client http://localhost:3000
cd foundation/app-server
npm run start-client-local
```

## Setup for Production

Use live data from the development environment. You need to make sure you have access to your deployed lambda functions. This works only after you deployed it to production.

```
cd foundation/app-server
npm run deploy-server-lambda-prod
```

## Testing

We use Jest as a test runner. To run all tests use

```
npm run test
```

To update component snapshots after updating a component use

```
npm run test:update
```

## Multiple package.json

In order to keep the total amount of code uploaded to AWS Lambda small the `foundation/app-server` directory containing the Serverless service has it's own `package.json`. This speeds up uploading and also should reduce the cold start time of Lambda functions. You don't have to run `npm install` manually at any point. It will only happen during deploy, but you need make sure every library you are consuming in your GraphQL endpoint is added as a dependency there.

### `app-client/package.json`

- dependencies: dependencies used by the front-end
- devDependencies: dependencies used to package the front-end application & running the local environment

### `foundation/app-server/package.json`

- dependencies: dependencies used on AWS Lambda
